				<p>	A little bit about myself, I'm from Redwood City, CA but grew up on the peninsula. My parents are from Managua, Nicaragua, which makes me Nicraguan-American (doesn't roll of the tongue that easily). I have 2 older sisters and I currently work at Stanford University as a Technical Consultant.
				I didn't always work in IT though. I started working in film right out of college. <br><br>I worked at a film festival in downtown San Jose called Cinequest. Then I was a production assistant for a local production company and would work from gig to gig, which included some video editing. <br><br>
				I have 2 dogs: Carmelo, he's a maltese-poodle mix and the other is Chloe, and she is a chihuahua mix. I also love watching sports including the San Francisco Giants, Golden State Warriors, San Jose Earthquakes and Sharks and the 49ers. I enjoy running and going to my crossfit gym during the week/weekends. </p>
